# Sticky-Sidebar-with-Scrolling-Content
This project showcases a webpage with a sticky sidebar and horizontally scrolling main content. The sidebar stays in place as you scroll through the content. It's designed to teach responsive web design and can help you learn how to add these features to your own web projects.
